    <p>Last updated October 26, 2024.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Preliminary statement</h2>

    <p>Alba Web Studio LLC (sometimes referred to in this policy as &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) maintains its online presence and provides services to customers and users via its website at https://findlocalhaunts.com (&quot;Website&quot;). The Website&apos;s primary purpose is: To connect local haunt attractions with visitors. One of the most important issues that any company must address is that of its customers&apos; and users&apos; privacy. We believe that our privacy policy is one that adheres to all relevant laws, regulations, and customs while at the same time is readily accessible and understandable. We take great pride in the trust that you place in us and our Website. For our Website to be effective, we must collect certain information from you. If you do not agree with any of the terms or practices described in this privacy policy, please do not access our Website or applications. Through the use of our Website, you are consenting to the provisions set forth in this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. If you want to make sure you are up to date with our privacy policy, we advise you to visit this page frequently.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What does our privacy policy cover?</h2>

    <p>This privacy policy covers our treatment of your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) that we may collect when you access our Website or any application. This privacy policy does not apply to the practices of any company that we do not control or own, people that we do not employ or directly manage, or third-party websites that we do not own, control, or manage. If you visit a website that we mention or link to, be sure to review that website&apos;s privacy policy.</p>
    <p>Our policy allows us to collect information from you in a manner that will allow you to retain control over your personal information, but still allow us to make your online visit to our Website safe, satisfying, and rewarding. We use your information to make it easier for you to access information and services provided on our Website. Since access to your account or profile on our Website requires authentication of your identity, some information is required to be provided for us to know who is accessing the Website and which areas that person has access to. The information allows us to provide you with a personalized experience. Use of any of the services on our Website is entirely voluntary; however, if you do not provide the Personally Identifiable Information if requested by us, then we may elect not to make the related services available for your use.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Information we collect</h2>

    <p>There are two types of general information that are typically collected online: Anonymous Information and Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
    <p>Anonymous Information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific person. While we may have a hit counter on a page on our Website, that counter only tracks the number of hits, it does not collect any specific information about our visitors. This is an example of Anonymous Information. While anonymous visitors are welcome to browse, registration and agreement to our Terms of Use are required to use our personalized services including the full features of our Website.</p>
    <p>Personally Identifiable Information is information that tells us about you and may include the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-4 my-4">
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Physical address</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>Photos and other information you store or post on our website</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and similar information that helps identify you. This information is needed to allow us to personalize your experience on our Website including the areas of our Website that only registered users are permitted to access. When we request Personally Identifiable Information from you, we may include a link to these privacy policies, and inform you what information is required and what information is optional.</p>
    <p>We may collect information from you directly in several ways such as when you place an order, create an account, become a member, maintain a &quot;wish list,&quot; complete a survey, or enter contest. We collect information&nbsp;&nbsp;if you choose to connect your social media account to your Website account, or if you contact us.</p>
    <p>We may collect information about you from third parties so we can provide better, more personalized content and services for you, such as our service and marketing partners, with whom we might co-brand, promote, or engage in joint marketing activities.</p>
    <p>We can collect information from your social media accounts if you give us permission. When creating an account on our Website, you may choose to link your social media accounts. Depending on the terms of the social media site, you may allow us to access to collect your personal information such as: your name, email address, profile picture, profile URL, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, information related to friends and followers, birthday, likes, education history, work history, current city, hometown, interests, relationship status, and location, posted messages and content, or other data made publicly available. By linking your social media account, we are not obligated to request further permission to collect information accessible through that account.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy does not cover the privacy and security practices for the sites where you have social media accounts. Rather, you should look to the social media sites&apos; respective terms of service and privacy policies to understand how they treat your information. If you no longer want your social media accounts linked to our Website, please follow the appropriate steps on the Website or email us at support@findlocalhaunts.com.</p>
    <p>If you register, you will be asked to enter certain Personally Identifiable Information. Some of this information may not be required to register as a user. You must keep your registration data current in order to maintain your account. This information continues to build your Personally Identifiable Information profile.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How we use your information</h2>

    <p>We use your information to improve your experience on our Website. We may use the information to:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4 my-4">
      <li>Process the transactions you request of us, such as to register an account, process orders and credit card transactions, or cash in your rewards</li>
      <li>Create and manage accounts</li>
      <li>Respond to your requests for help, comments, or concerns about our Website&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Notify you if we materially update our privacy policy or terms of use.</li>
      <li>Conduct market research, manage our promotions, or tell you about our products, services, or special offers on our own products or third-party products we think you might find interesting</li>
      <li>Improve our products and services, by combining information that we have collected offline, online, from third-party sites, and from devices to help us understand and improve our Website</li>
      <li>Protect against fraud and for security purposes</li>
      <li>Comply with legal or regulatory requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Users who are children and their parents</h2>

    <p>Our Website does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from and about children. We are sensitive to the issues involved in collecting such information from children and have taken steps to ensure the privacy of any minors accessing our Website. If it is determined that such information has been inadvertently collected, we will take the steps necessary to ensure that such information is deleted from our database or that verifiable parental consent is obtained. Our Website established guidelines that operate in connection with our adherence to the Federal Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA): <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm</a>. We strongly agree with the intent of COPPA and have structured our COPPA policy to enable us to collect only the information from children that is necessary for their access to our Website service; and, then only after obtaining verifiable consent from their parents.</p>
    <p>We strongly recommend that any information about children submitted to our Website be of the type that would typically appear in a local newspaper. Accordingly, information that is not appropriate for local newspapers should not be posted to our Website.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Information we share</h2>

    <p>We will not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your Personally Identifiable Information to anyone except as provided in this privacy policy. However, we may send Personally Identifiable Information about our users to other companies or people when:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4 my-4">
      <li>we need to share your Personally Identifiable Information to provide a product or service that you requested;</li>
      <li>we need to send the Personally Identifiable Information to third parties that provide services on our behalf to provide you with a product or service you requested;</li>
      <li>we use marketing partners to help us audit the quality and effectiveness of advertisements, provide analytic services and similar services;</li>
      <li>we use third parties (such as Google and/or Facebook) to collect and analyze information about the use of our Website. This information helps us provide relevant advertisements to you and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;</li>
      <li>we use third-party shipping and credit card processing partners to enable them to properly fulfill your product and service requests. Our partners are not permitted to retain, share, store or use this Personally Identifiable Information for any secondary or other purposes not directly related to fulfillment of your product and service requests;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>we have your consent to share your Personally Identifiable Information;</li>
      <li>we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes or take other steps to remain in compliance with applicable laws; or</li>
      <li>we find that your actions on our Website violate our Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In most respects, you will deal directly with our third-party advertisers and their shipping and credit card processing partners. Therefore, our users should carefully review our advertisers&apos; privacy policies and terms and conditions prior to entering into a transaction with such advertisers.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Cookies</h2>

    <p>We collect information about you through online tracking. We use, as do third-party service providers, tracking technology like browser cookies, web beacons and pixels on our Website, applications, and in emails we send to you. Cookies are pieces of data stored on hard drives that contain information about you and your activity. Web beacons and pixels help us understand how you interact with our Website. Cookies are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information while users are on our Website. Cookies may allow you to only log into the Website once while remembering your username and password for future access. Cookies may be rejected by you, but the rejection may result in more limited access to the services we provide since our services may be personalized to you. Cookies may also be used to allow access to sweepstakes, contests and other events. Some of our advertisers utilize cookies; however, we do not have control over or access to their cookies. We use cookies to monitor Website activity, not user activity. If you choose not to accept cookies, you should be aware that you may not be able to experience the full functionality of our Website.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Links</h2>

    <p>Our Website contains links to other websites. Some of these websites may display our product logos, our products, or other content provided by us. Please understand that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. We recommend that you be aware when you leave our Website and that you read the privacy policies of the other websites to see how they treat information they collect. By providing access to third-party websites or advertisements, we are not endorsing the products or services provided by the owners or operators of such websites. Consequently, we will not be responsible for the accuracy, relevancy, availability, reliability, copyright compliance, legality or decency of the material contained in such third-party websites linked to our Website. We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction. This privacy policy applies only to the information collected by us via our Website.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Security</h2>

    <p>We take our commitment to protect your information seriously. When you submit sensitive information to our Website, the information is protected both online and offline.</p>
    <p>When our registration and order forms request you to enter sensitive information (credit card or social security numbers), the information is encrypted and is protected with SSL technology.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Even though we use SSL encryption technology to protect your sensitive information online, we also employ internal procedures to protect sensitive information offline. Access to all of our users&apos; sensitive information is restricted to only those employees that require access. We instruct our employees during the course of their tenure regarding protecting our users&apos; confidential and sensitive information and we perform periodic checks of how the employees adhere to our policies. We maintain our servers in a secure and locked facility that restricts access to only those employees and technicians that require access. Our security policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Only authorized employees and technicians have access to the information provided by our users.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Due to the nature of technology, you are also partially responsible for the security of their information. Since people have become accustomed to the internet, browser technology has made it easier for everyone to return to their favorite websites without re-entering their usernames and passwords. While this is easier for surfing, when Personally Identifiable Information is associated with the log-in information, your security could be affected. We strongly recommend that you do not save their username and password in your browsers and that you either remember their log-in information or store your usernames and passwords separately to avoid unauthorized access to your information from your devices.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Additional information regarding our security practices can be obtained by emailing questions to support@findlocalhaunts.com.</p>
    <p>We also offer the following advice:</p>
    <p>&bull; If you share your device with other people, remember to log off our Website before leaving it.</p>
    <p>&bull; Don&apos;t share your password with anyone. If you store your log in information in your computer, remember to password protect that information. No one from our Website will ever ask for your password.</p>
    <p>&bull; If asked, don&apos;t give out your personal information.</p>
    <p>&bull; If you are unsure about the information you are providing, ask us, another administrator, or another person before posting the information.</p>
    <p>&bull; If there is information that you would not like to see in your local newspaper, don&apos;t post it to our Website.</p>
    <p>&bull; When in doubt, ask us at support@findlocalhaunts.com.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Special offers</h2>

    <p>Each user that registers may be welcomed with an email message that verifies their username and password.
